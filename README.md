 Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning
 Abstract
 Heart disease remains one of the most significant global health issues, emphasizing the importance of early detection and intervention. This project leverages machine learning to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on behavioral and demographic data from the 2015 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). The study explores four classifiers—Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost—to identify key predictors such as blood pressure, cholesterol, physical activity, gender, education, and income level. Among them, XGBoost and Logistic Regression demonstrated the most robust and accurate performance. This project supports the development of cost-effective, scalable predictive tools that can help in preventive healthcare strategies
